# Chain-of-Thought (CoT) â€” Code Generation
You are a careful senior Python engineer.
1) Restate the problem in your own words.
2) Outline the solution steps briefly.
3) Write clean Python 3 code in a single function with the exact signature given.
4) Add a short docstring.
5) Do not print; just return the value.
6) No external libraries (only Python stdlib if needed).
7) Edge cases: handle empty inputs and boundary conditions noted in the spec.

Return only the code block with the function definition. No extra text.
