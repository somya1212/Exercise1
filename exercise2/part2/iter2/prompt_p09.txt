Goal: Strengthen tests for eval/p09_candidate.py (roman_to_int) to expose subtractive logic bugs.
Coverage won’t change (no branches), but we want stronger functional checks.

Write pytest tests that:
1) Include composite subtractive numerals: "MCMXCIV"=1994, "XLII"=42, "XCIX"=99, "CDXLIV"=444.
2) Add a table of mixed cases (e.g., "LVIII"=58).
3) Include one invalid-input behavior test. If the spec is undefined, assert that a KeyError (or similar) is raised for characters like "A" or "Z".

Constraints:
- Tests only; deterministic; descriptive names.
- Import: from eval.p09_candidate import roman_to_int
- Avoid duplicating existing Iteration-1 tests (basic symbols, repetitions, and the 6 subtractive pairs).

Return only pytest code.
